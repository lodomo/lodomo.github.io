## Created Repository

### February 18th, 2025

Created the repository IAW guidelines from the "Final Project - Winter 2025.pdf"

## Using my previous work

### February 18th, 2025

On February 8th, I panic made a portfolio webpage for a job application.
I sat down at my computer for 13 hours and knocked it out. I want to take some
of those ideas and just actually make it look good. I've created a separate
branch called "old" in the repository so you can see what code I'm starting from.

## Created the basic structure

### February 27th, 2025

I've created the basic structure of the site. I've added a header, a footer, and
a main section. I added bootstrap to the project, and made a blank css and js
file. I added the "favicon.svg" that I designed myself.

I really want the site to be "juicy" when you scroll, I'm doing some planning
on how to make that happen.

I have a few text based games I've made in Python, and an idea for a form to PDF
generator as the "little extra" for the project. I think the form-to-PDF will
be the most straight forward to build on the skills from this class.

My poor text adventures have been collecting dust, and I think they would be
fun to have on the site. I'll decide over the next couple days on the scope
I can reasonably accomplish.

## API for Email / Branding

### February 28th 2025

I found a service that will let me receive emails from the site.
https://web3forms.com/

Looks like it's pretty easy to setup.

I spent a good while getting my logo design complete. I've been playing with this
for years and hit a stride where I really like it. It's not really web dev, but
it's getting this website prepared.

## Fonts!

### March 1st 2025

I researched how to import fonts. I didnt like anything on google fonts, and honestly
am trying to avoid google products at all cost. I found a font I wanted, downloaded it
and used https://transfonter.org/ to convert it to a web font.

That generated the CSS I needed to import the font, and I added it to my project.
I'll be putting comments on code generated by transfonter.

## API calls

### March 1st 2025

I think I want to get the contact form to actually DM me on bluesky from a bot account.
I'm going to look into how to do that, and see if I can get it working. I
might need to expose API keys to use github.io and don't want to do that...

## Bots, and Branding

### March 3rd 2025

I've been working on the branding/logo for site. Fixed the d's in the logo.
I've output the computer logo with the "lodomo.dev" text for the nav bar, and
just the text for the splash screen.

I created the bsky bot and am going to be hosting that on my private server since
the API key (technically just Username/Password) will be exposed.
I'll have a version of that script just on this repository, but the site will be
making calls to the external API to protect the key.

Doing all the design work and then coding it is a lot of work, I hope I have enough
time to get it all done.

## Switching to Jquery
### March 4th 2025

Jquery seems pretty powerful for what I want to do, and kinda already does the stuff
I wrote functions for. I'm going to switch to Jquery to see if I can get this written
faster and cleaner.

## Actually no.
### March 5th 2025

I started writing in Jquery and maybe it's a good tool but it totally ruins the readability
for me, and feels like I'm giving a lot of control over to the library.

I'm going back to writing my own functions so I get a better feel of how things are working.
