## Created Repository
### February 18th, 2025

Created the repository IAW guidelines from the "Final Project - Winter 2025.pdf"

## Using my previous work
### February 18th, 2025

On February 8th, I panic made a portfolio webpage for a job application. 
I sat down at my computer for 13 hours and knocked it out. I want to take some 
of those ideas and just actually make it look good. I've created a separate 
branch called "old" in the repository so you can see what code I'm starting from.

## Created the basic structure
### February 27th, 2025

I've created the basic structure of the site. I've added a header, a footer, and
a main section. I added bootstrap to the project, and made a blank css and js 
file. I added the "favicon.svg" that I designed myself.

I really want the site to be "juicy" when you scroll, I'm doing some planning
on how to make that happen.

I have a few text based games I've made in Python, and an idea for a form to PDF
generator as the "little extra" for the project. I think the form-to-PDF will
be the most straight forward to build on the skills from this class.

My poor text adventures have been collecting dust, and I think they would be
fun to have on the site. I'll decide over the next couple days on the scope 
I can reasonably accomplish.

## API for Email / Branding
### February 28th 2025

I found a service that will let me receive emails from the site.
https://web3forms.com/

Looks like it's pretty easy to setup.

I spent a good while getting my logo design complete. I've been playing with this
for years and hit a stride where I really like it. It's not really web dev, but
it's getting this website prepared.

## Fonts!
### March 1st 2025

I researched how to import fonts. I didnt like anything on google fonts, and honestly
am trying to avoid google products at all cost. I found a font I wanted, downloaded it
and used https://transfonter.org/ to convert it to a web font.

That generated the CSS I needed to import the font, and I added it to my project.
I'll be putting comments on code generated by transfonter.

## API calls
### March 1st 2025

I think I want to get the contact form to actually DM me on bluesky from a bot account.
I'm going to look into how to do that, and see if I can get it working. I
might need to expose API keys to use github.io and don't want to do that...
