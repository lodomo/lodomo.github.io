## Using my previous work
### February 18th, 2025

On February 8th, I panic made a portfolio webpage for a job application. 
I sat down at my computer for 13 hours and knocked it out. I want to take some 
of those ideas and just actually make it look good. I've created a separate 
branch called "old" in the repository so you can see what code I'm starting from.
