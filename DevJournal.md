## Created Repository
### February 18th, 2025

Created the repository IAW guidelines from the "Final Project - Winter 2025.pdf"

## Using my previous work
### February 18th, 2025

On February 8th, I panic made a portfolio webpage for a job application. 
I sat down at my computer for 13 hours and knocked it out. I want to take some 
of those ideas and just actually make it look good. I've created a separate 
branch called "old" in the repository so you can see what code I'm starting from.

## Created the basic structure
### February 27th, 2025

I've created the basic structure of the site. I've added a header, a footer, and
a main section. I added bootstrap to the project, I downloaded the files instead
of linking them to prevent updates from breaking my site. I've also added an
empty stylesheet and "main.js" file.

I really want the site to be "juicy" when you scroll, I'm doing some planning
on how to make that happen.

I have a few text based games I've made in Python, and an idea for a form to PDF
generator as the "little extra" for the project. I think the form-to-PDF will
be the most straight forward to build on the skills from this class.

My poor text adventures have been collecting dust, and I think they would be
fun to have on the site. I'll decide over the next couple days on the scope 
I can reasonably accomplish.
