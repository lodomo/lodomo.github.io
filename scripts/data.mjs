  "I'm a dad, a nerd, a builder, and a problem-solver. Whether it’s coding, gaming, or tackling hands-on projects, I love figuring out how things work and making them better. Before dedicating my time to software, I spent nine years in the U.S. Navy, earning the rank of First Class Petty Officer and achieving my Master Training Specialist certification. That experience taught me leadership, discipline, and how to break down complex problems. Now, I’m wrapping up my Computer Science degree at Portland State University, set to graduate in June 2025.",
  "I'm passionate about creating things that bring fun into the world. I've won awards for my game design and development, and I'm always looking for new ways to innovate. I have a strong ethical compass. Technology should make life better for everyone.",
